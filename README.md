# Natural Numbers Sum Calculator

Simple JavaScript web application that allows users to calculate the sum of consecutive natural numbers and visualize the calculation steps.

## Description
This project allows users to:
- input a natural number N
- calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N
- see the calculation steps displayed dynamically (e.g., "1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N = sum")
- get feedback if the input is invalid (negative number, non-integer, or empty input)

The application validates user input to ensure correctness. The calculation logic is separated into modular, testable JavaScript functions for maintainability.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap 5)
- JavaScript (ES modules)
- DOM manipulation for interactive UI
